<h2>1.11 Pushing Remotely</h2>
<p>The push command tells Git where to put our commits when we're ready, and boy we're ready. So let's push our local changes to our origin repo (on GitHub).</p>

<p>The name of our remote is origin and the default local branch name is master. The -u tells Git to remember the parameters, so that next time we can simply run git push and Git will know what to do. Go ahead and push it!</p>

<code>git push -u origin master</code>
