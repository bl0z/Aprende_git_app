<h2>1.12 Pulling Remotely</h2>
<p>Let's pretend some time has passed. We've invited other people to our GitHub project who have pulled your changes, made their own commits, and pushed them.</p>

<p>We can check for changes on our GitHub repository and pull down any new changes by running:</p>

<code>git pull origin master</code>
