<h2>1.16 Resetting the Stage</h2>
<p>So now that octodog is part of the family, octocat is all depressed. Since we love octocat more than octodog, we'll turn his frown around by removing octodog.txt.</p>

<p>You can unstage files by using the git reset command. Go ahead and remove octofamily/octodog.txt.</p>

<code>git reset octofamily/octodog.txt</code>
