<h2>1.18 Branching Out</h2>
<p>When developers are working on a feature or bug they'll often create a copy (aka. branch) of their code they can make separate commits to. Then when they're done they can merge this branch back into their main master branch.</p>

<p>We want to remove all these pesky octocats, so let's create a branch called clean_up, where we'll do all the work:</p>

<code>git branch clean_up</code>
