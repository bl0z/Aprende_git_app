<h2>1.19 Switching Branches</h2>
<p>Great! Now if you type git branch you'll see two local branches: a main branch named master and your new branch named clean_up.</p>

<p>You can switch branches using the git checkout < branch> command. Try it now to switch to the clean_up branch:</p>

<code>git checkout clean_up</code>
