<h2>1.22 Switching Back to master</h2>
<p>Great, you're almost finished with the cat... er the bug fix, you just need to switch back to the master branch so you can copy (or merge) your changes from the clean_up branch back into the master branch.</p>

<p>Go ahead and checkout the master branch:</p>

<code>git checkout master</code>
