<h2>1.24 Keeping Things Clean</h2>
<p>Congratulations! You just accomplished your first successful bugfix and merge. All that's left to do is clean up after yourself. Since you're done with the clean_up branch you don't need it anymore.</p>

<p>You can use git branch -d < branch name> to delete a branch. Go ahead and delete the clean_up branch now:</p>

<code>git branch -d clean_up</code>
