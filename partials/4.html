<h2>1.4 Adding Changes</h2>
<p>Good, it looks like our Git repository is working properly. Notice how Git says octocat.txt is "untracked"? That means Git sees that octocat.txt is a new file.</p>

<p>To tell Git to start tracking changes made to octocat.txt, we first need to add it to the staging area by using git add.</p>

<code>git add octocat.txt</code>
